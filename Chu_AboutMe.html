           <p>Hi! My name is Angela Chu and this year I’m a junior at Dublin High School. 
           For my career goals, I plan on becoming a creative writer. 
           For as long as I can remember, I’ve loved articulating my thoughts onto paper, developing boundless interest in inventive writing assignments in elementary school. 
           Though other subjects have sparked my interest, as of now my enthusiasm for writing has been revived, and I plan to start writing again in the near future. 
           Through composing an abundance of fictional narratives, I will be able to practice developing a captivating plot and conflict in addition to emotionally complex characters. 
           This year, I’m taking Computer Science to experience coding and its different languages. I have no intention of continuing in a computer programming path, 
           though I have learned a significant amount with regards to projects revolving around Scratch and MIT App Inventor. 
           In the future, I plan to major in creative writing.</p>
           
           <p>Strengths I possess are being able to type relatively fast (peaking at 144 WPM), possessing considerably strong grammar and syntax, as well as being patient and understanding towards others. 
           I do my best to help those who need it, and I grow stronger as an individual when I miscalculate and erroneously carry out specific tasks. 
           This year my workload has increased significantly as opposed to last year when homework was relatively light. 
           I have learned that it is challenging for me to stay focused for long periods of time, and taking more weighted classes has helped me realize the
           importance of time management and inhibition of procrastination. </p>
           
           <p>I’m currently the secretary for both the Clay for Cancer and Caring Hands Crochet club. Undertaking both of these positions has helped me become more organized and punctual, 
           as it requires me sending emails bi-weekly for each club. 
           As for extracurriculars, I’ve been playing the piano for 10 years. I’ve recently halted classes due to a busy schedule, but I do often find myself practicing every now and then. 
           With regard to sports, I have been formally playing Badminton for a little over a year at this point. 
           </p>
           
           <p>In conclusion, I’m looking forward to what the future holds in terms of my career choice. 
           Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio.</p>

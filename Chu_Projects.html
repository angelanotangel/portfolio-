                <p>Project: MIT App Inventor</p>
                <p>Course: Computer Science (CSE)</p>
                <p>September 19th, 2017 - October 6th, 2017</p>
                <p>The objective of the project was to modify the code of an app; 
                creating a more complex version with  additional features. 
                My partner and I were tasked with the job of creating a QuizMe app,
                where the user would be asked trivia questions and would earn points accordingly.
                My partner combined the correct command blocks according to the tutorial, 
                creating the overarching structure of the app. 
                Afterwards, I made several modifications, including a jeopardy 
                music button, auditory  hints for each question, 
                and an end screen where a user  was ranked based on the number 
                of points they earned. I learned to find command blocks quickly 
                using the convenient search feature, and gained further experience with “if then” statements. 
                We agreed amongst the modifications we would make and overall produced a successful QuizMe app.</p>

            <p>Project: Text Adventure Project</p>
            <p>Course: Computer Science (CSE)</p>
            <p>January 11th, 2018 - January 19th, 2018</p>
            <p>The objective of the project was to utilize if-else statements 
            to create a fun text adventure game where the user could use the player's 
            course of action. My partner and I both wrote the adventure, synthesizing 
            an intriguing plot where a traveller gets sucked into an alternate 
            reality where they must find a way to escape. My partner and I 
            both worked on the code, defining different functions and creating 
            new elements of the plot as time went along. In the end, both of us 
            gained more experience with if-else statements, concatenation, 
            and raw input and were able to successfully complete the project.</p>

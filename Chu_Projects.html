                <p>Project: MIT App Inventor</p>
                <p>Course: Computer Science (CSE)</p>
                <p>September 19th, 2017 - October 6th, 2017</p>
                <p>The objective of the project was to modify the code of an app; creating a more complex version with  additional features. My partner and I were tasked with the job of creating a QuizMe app, where the user would be asked trivia questions and would earn points accordingly.
                My partner combined the correct command blocks according to the tutorial, creating the overarching structure of the app. 
                Afterwards, I made several modifications, including a jeopardy music button, auditory  hints for each question, 
                and an end screen where a user  was ranked based on the number of points they earned. I learned to find command blocks quickly using the convenient search feature, and gained further experience with “if then” statements. 
                We agreed amongst the modifications we would make and overall produced a successful QuizMe app.</p>
